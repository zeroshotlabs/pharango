# pharango - PHP Driver for Arrango DB

Since ArangoDB has stopped supporting PHP, we needed a modern replacement, so this library was largely generated from the HTTP API docs using GPT.

Flavors of it are in production but it's still very actively updated and added to, such as graphs.

Feel free to pull your own generated patches or be a regular contributor!
